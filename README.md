# Dribbble Challenge üèÄ

üèü live site: https://dribbble-1bba9.web.app/

## How did I approach this challenge? ü§î

I started this challenge by checking the provided JSON URL paths in Postman. Once I saved each path needed (ex. shot.author.avatarUrl) I proceeded to create-react-app. I started with a barebones html site to test each path making sure it loaded into the localhost. I ran into an issue with CORS so setup a workaround using [cors-anywhere](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere). Once I had everything loaded from the JSON URL I proceeded to make it all as nice as I could according to the thumnail provided.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
