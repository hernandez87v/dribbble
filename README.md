# Dribbble Challenge üèÄ

## How did I approach this challenge? ü§î

I started this challenge by checking the provided JSON URL paths in Postman. Once I saved each path needed (ex. shot.author.avatarUrl) I proceeded to create-react-app. I started with a barebones html site to test each path making sure it loaded into the localhost. I ran into an issue with CORS so setup a workaround using [cors-anywhere](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere). Once I had everything loaded from the JSON URL I proceeded to make it all as nice as I could according to the thumnail provided.

## What would I do with more time? ‚åö

- The clock was ticking and I had started this challenge wanting to use VueJS but found out quickly that I would be able to get a lot more done with ReactJS as I'm more familiar with it.

- I had set everything up in one page hoping there would be time to seperate into components later.

- I'm itching to just spruce up the css and get this all pixel perfect

- Also holding back from further changes so I can meet requirements to get as close as possible to a perfect lighthouse score.

- Figure out and fix the CORS issue so a workaround isnt needed.
